This is a collection of different implementations of a simple 2D dungeon
game, "Dandy Dungeon". I wrote the original version in [6502 assembly for
the Atari 800](https://github.com/jackpal/Dandy-Dungeon/tree/master/dandy-atari-8-bit).

I've written versions numerous other languages since then:

+ coffee-script
+ C++ (for Xbox and Windows)
+ C# (1.0, 1.2, 2.0)
+ Dart
+ F#
+ JavaScript
+ Objective-C
+ Python
+ Swift

It is a bit obsessive-compulsive to keep revisiting the same program,
but it helps me get a feel for a new programming language. Perhaps it might
be useful for other people wishing to compare and contrast different programming
langauge styles.
